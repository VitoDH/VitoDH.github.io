> A man has only one destiny.

Hi, I am _@vitodh_ (Dehai, Liu), a Data Scientist Intern at Microsoft and a master student of Statistics from University of Washington. My interests mainly relate to Machine Learning and Deep Learning includes tree models, time series analysis and natural language processing. 




##### My Programming Languages Spectrum

Basically I often use programming language for modeling. Recently, I am learning front-end and back-end languages to demo my projects.
