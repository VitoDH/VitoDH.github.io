## 1. Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.



In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.

* **Goal:** Improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course

* **Null Hypothesis :** This approach doesn't affect the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time

* **Alternative Hypothesis :** This approach reduce the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time, without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course

* **Unit of Diversion**: Cookie
  * Although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward
  * The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice
  * For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page



## 2. Experimental Design

### Metric Choice

_**Invariant Metrics :** number of cookies, number of clicks, click-through-probability._

_**Evaluation Metrics :** gross conversion, retention, net conversion._



Notes for definition of metrics:

* Unique cookies: the uniqueness is determined by day
* Practical significance boundary (given in parentheses) : the difference that would have to be observed before that was a meaningful change for the business



#### Invariant Metrics

Metrics remain invariant throughout the experiment. One could expect a similar distribution of such metrics both on control and experiment side. In the given experiment, the invariant metrics are as follows -

**Number of cookies (d_min=3000):** Number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. This is the unit of diversion 

**Number of clicks (d_min=240):** Number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger).

**Click-through-probability (d_min=0.01):** That is, number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. 



#### Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics are metrics that we expect to see a difference between the experiment group and the control group. In order to launch the project,  the minimal difference of the metrics (d_min)  in two groups must be observed (within the confidence interval). 

**Gross conversion (d_min=0.01):** Number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button.

**Retention (d_min=0.01):** Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout.

**Net conversion (d_min=0.0075):** Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the "Start free trial" button.



The ultimate goal is to minimize student frustration and use the limited coaching resources most efficiently. With this in mind, the following conditions must be satisfied -

- Increased retention, i.e the ratio of users who remained enrolled past the 14-day boundary to the number of users to complete checkout should increase.
- Decreased gross conversion coupled to increase in net conversion, i.e less students enrolling in free trial but more students staying beyond the free trial.



#### Unused Metrics

**Number of user-ids (d_min=50):** Number of users who enroll in the free trial. User-ids are tracked only after enrolling in the free trial and equal distribution between the control and experimental groups would not be expected. User-id count could be used to evaluate how many enrollments stayed beyond the 14 day free trial boundary, but since it isn't normalized, I have elected not to use it.



## 3. Measuring Standard Deviation

***Analytical Estimate of Standard Deviation of Evaluation Metrics***

</table>

For each of the metrics the standard deviation is calculated for a sample size of 5000 unique cookies visiting the course overview page. The standard deviation are calculated using the [Baseline Values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0).



# 4. Sizing

The following calculation is based on [Baseline Values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0).



### Number of Samples vs Power

Page views required for each evaluation metric is calculated separately using the [online calculator](<https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html>). The alpha value of 0.05 and beta value of 0.2 are used in all the cases.



***Pageviews for Each Evaluation Metric to Achieve Target Statistical
Power***

#### Gross Conversion

* Baseline Conversion: 0.20625
* Minimum Difference: 0.01
* Alpha: 0.05
* Beta: 0.2  - Power(1 - Beta): 0.8
* Sample Size = **25,835** enrollments/group 
* Number of groups = 2 (experiment and control) 
* Total sample size = **51,670** enrollments 
* Clicks/Pageview: 3200/40000 = 0.08 clicks/pageview 
* Pageviews Required = **6,45,875**



#### Retention

* Baseline Conversion: 0.53
* Minimum Detectable Effect: 0.01
* Alpha: 0.05
* Beta: 0.2
* Power   (1 - Beta): 0.8
* Sample size = **39,115** enrollments/group 
* Number of groups = 2 (experiment and control) 
* Total sample size = **78,230** enrollments 
* Enrollments/pageview: 660/40000 = 0.0165 enrollments/pageview 
* Pageviews = 78,230/0.0165 = **47,41,212**



#### Net Conversion

* Baseline Conversion: 0.1093125
* Minimum Detectable Effect: 0.0075
* Alpha: 0.05
* Beta: 0.2
* Power  (1 - Beta): 0.8
* Sample size = **27,413** enrollments/group 
* Number of groups = 2 (experiment and control) 
* Total sample size = **54,826** enrollments 
* Enrollments/pageview: 3200/40000 = 0.08 clicks/pageview 
* Pageviews =54826/0.08=  **6,85,325**

*Pageviews required is maximum of pageviews required for Gross Conversion, Retention, Net Conversion. Therefore, the required pageviews  is 47,41,212.*



### Duration and Exposure

* If we divert 100% of traffic, given 40,000 page views per day, the
  experiment would take 119 days.
*  If we eliminate retention from the metrics, we are left with Gross Conversion and Net Conversion. This reduces the number of required pageviews to **685,325**, and 18 days for experiment with 100%
  diversion and 35 days given 50% diversion.

A 119 day experiment with 100% diversion of traffic presents two risks:

*  business risk (potential for: frustrated students, lower conversion and retention, and inefficient use of coaching resources) 
*  opportunity risk (performing other experiments). However, in general, this is not a
  risky experiment as the change would not be expected to cause a precipitous drop in enrollment. In terms of timing, an 18 day experiment is more reasonable, but 50% diversion may be scaled down depending on other experiments of interest to be performed concurrently.



# 5. Experiment Analysis

The experiment data can be found in the following links :

* [Control Group Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu5u9GrybDdska-ljPXyBjTpdZIUev_6i7t4LRDfXM8/edit#gid=0) 
* [Experiment Group Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mu5u9GrybDdska-ljPXyBjTpdZIUev_6i7t4LRDfXM8/edit#gid=154400404)



The meaning of each column is:

- **Pageviews:** Number of unique cookies to view the course overview page that day.
- **Clicks:** Number of unique cookies to click the course overview page that day.
- **Enrollments:** Number of user-ids to enroll in the free trial that day.
- **Payments:** Number of user-ids who who enrolled on that day to remain enrolled for 14 days and thus make a payment. (Note that the date for this column is the start date, that is, the date of enrollment, rather than the date of the payment. The payment happened 14 days later. Because of this, the enrollments and payments are tracked for 14 fewer days than the other columns.)



### Sanity Checks

This check is primarily for the invariant metrics. For invariant metrics we expect equal diversion into the experiment and control group. We will test this at the 95% confidence interval.



Notes:

*  If the invariant metric is a simple count (Number of cookies and Number of clicks) that should be randomly split between the 2 groups, use a binomial test to see whether the observed value falls within the confidence interval (Lesson 5)
* If not (Click through probability), construct a confidence interval for a difference in proportions, then check whether the difference between group values falls within that confidence level (Lesson 1)
  * Method 1: We use control group's value as expected value and calculate the confidence interval as the simple count does
  * Method 2: As in Lesson 1, we calculate the confidence interval of the difference between two groups

### Sign Tests

Sign test is a nonparametric method to validate the result obtained above. The sensitivity of sign test is lower than that of the above test since we don't have any assumptions. The p-value is calculated by this [online calculator](https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/binomial1.cfm).

# 6. Conclusion

An experiment was conducted in which potential Udacity students were diverted by cookie into two groups, experiment and control. The experiment group was asked to input the amount of time they are willing
to devote to study, after clicking a "start free trial button", where as the control group was not. 

Three invariant metrics (Number of Cookies,Number of clicks on "start free trial", and Click-Through-Probability) were chosen for purposes of validation and sanity checking while Gross Conversion (enrollment/cookie) and Net Conversion (payments/cookie)served as evaluation metrics. 

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the evaluation metrics between the groups, furthermore, a practical significance threshold was set for each metric. The requirement for launching the experiment is that the null hypothesis must be rejected for all evaluation metrics and that the difference between two groups must meet or exceed the practical significance threshold.

 Because our acceptance criteria requires statistically significant differences for all evaluation metrics,  Bonferonni correction will not be used here. The Bonferonni correction is a method for controlling for type I errors (false positives) when using multiple metrics in which relevance of any of the metrics matches the hypothesis. In this case the risk of type I errors increases as the number of metrics increases (significance by random chance).

Analysis revealed the expected equal distribution of cookies into the control and experimental groups, for the invariant metrics, at the 95% CI. A difference in gross conversion was found to be statistically significant at the 95% CI, and the null hypothesis was rejected. Gross conversion also met the practical significance threshold. Net Conversion was found to be neither statistically nor practically significant at the 95% CI.



# 7. Recommendation

This experiment was designed to determine whether filtering students as a function of study time commitment would improve the overall student experience and the coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course, without significantly reducing the number of students who continue past the free trial. 

A statistically and practically significant decrease in Gross Conversion was observed but with no significant differences in Net Conversion. This translates to a decrease in enrollment not coupled to an increase in students staying for the requisite 14 days to trigger payment. Considering this, my recommendation is **not to launch**, but rather to pursue other experiments.



# 8. Follow-up Experiment

The construction of student frustration could be assigned an operational definition of "cancel early," where a convenient definition and measure of early cancellation is prior to the end of the 14 day trial period in
which payment is triggered. An early cancellation is not necessarily indicative of frustration but could be from other causes, such as a course not being aligned to the students needs or expectations in terms of content. For preventing early cancellation there are two primary logical timepoint opportunities for intervention, (1) pre-enrollment, and (2) post-enrollment but pre-payment.

The first opportunity for intervention was explored above where in a poll regarding time commitment was used as to filter out students likely to become frustrated. This filter focused only on time commitment to the class and did not address other reasons why a student might become frustrated and cancel early. Even if the student was sincere in their response and diligent in their study, they may become frustrated if they don't have the suggested pre-requisite skills and experience. That is, their committed time may not be enough if they don't come in with the pre-requisite skill set. Adding a **checklist** of pre-requisite skills to the popup regarding time commitment may be informative. This experiment would leverage the infrastructure and data pipeline of the original experiment and be set up in the same way as the original, including the unit of diversion. The only difference would be the information in the form. If the student's answer meets the time and pre-requisite requirements (radio box checklist) they are directed to enroll in the free trial, otherwise they are encouraged to access the free version. This experiment would be low cost in terms of resources and may increase the selectivity of the pre-enrollment filter. A successful experiment would be one in which there is a significant decrease in Gross Conversion coupled to a significant increase in Net
Conversion.

A variety of approaches could be used to intervene post-enrollment but pre-payment and could be deployed concurrently with pre-enrollment intervention. An ideal approach would be one which minimizes the use of additional coaching resources to best meet the original intent of the intervention. An effective approach may be to employ peer coaching/guidance by means of team formation. If a student has a team of other students which they could consult, discuss coursework and frustrations with, and be accountable to, they may be more likely to stick out the growing pains and stay for the long term. The experiment would function in the following manner.

**Setup:** Upon enrollment students will either be randomly assigned to a control group in which they are not funneled into a team, or an experiment group in which they are.

**Null Hypothesis:** Participation in a team will not increase the number of students enrolled beyond the 14 day free trial period by a significant amount.

**Unit of Diversion:** The unit of diversion will be user-id as the change takes place after a student creates an account and enrolls in a course.

**Invariant Metrics:** The invariant metric will be user-id, since an equal distribution between experiment and control would be expected as a property of the setup.

**Evaluation Metrics:** The evaluation metric will be **Retention**. A statistically and practically significant increase in Retention would indicate that the change is successful.

If a statistically and practically significant positive change in Retention is observed, assuming an acceptable impact on overall Udacity resources (setting up and maintaining teams will require resource use), the experiment will be launched.
